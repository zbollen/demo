- One participant with 8 trials appears to be a partial completion (check raw data?)
- One participant with 144 trials appears to be a repeat participant. I've chosen to exclude them entirely, but you could also have a more elaborate strategy where you retain only their first completion.

# Self-reports

  summarize(mean_evaluation = mean(response, na.rm = TRUE))

# Write to disk

```{r}

# in case this dir doesn't exist, create it
dir.create("../data/processed/")

# save data to disk in that dir
write_csv(data_processed, "../data/processed/data_processed.csv")

```

# Create codebook template for the processed data

If it has not already been created, this code write the codebook template to disk. 

\TODO The template should then be filled in manually with descriptions of each variable so that someone else could understand what these variables represent. 

```{r}

if(!file.exists("../data/processed/data_processed_codebook.xlsx")){
  # convert the column names to a df
  codebook_template <- data.frame(variable = colnames(data_processed)) |>
    mutate(explanation = NA)
  # write to disk as an excel file
  write.xlsx(codebook_template, file = "../data/processed/data_processed_codebook.xlsx")
}

```

Note that there are other ways of automatically creating more elaborate codebooks from your datasets. These often contain information about min/max/mean/SD, distribution, etc. For example:
